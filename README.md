# Nutrition & Lifestyle Hub (Static Site)

This bundle contains a ready-to-publish static website with 10 sections (Pregnancy + 0–24 years).

## Replace media
Each section has a `media/` directory with subfolders:
- `videos/` – `.mp4` placeholders
- `flipbooks/` – `.pdf` placeholders
- `comics/` – `.html` stubs
- `podcasts/` – `.mp3` placeholders
- `articles/` – `.html` stubs
- `posters/`, `flipcharts/`, `tools/` – assorted placeholders

Replace each placeholder with your real asset using the same filename, or update the links in the section's `index.html`.

## Deploy on GitHub Pages
1. Create a new repo and upload the folder contents.
2. In **Settings → Pages**, choose **Deploy from a branch** and set root.
3. Open `https://<username>.github.io/<repo>/`.

## Local preview
Open `index.html` in any browser.
